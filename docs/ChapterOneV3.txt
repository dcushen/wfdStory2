Rustafied

Rust is a game which is made up of an average of 60-200 players, set on an island featuring abandoned monuments, decaying structures and players with a lust for blood. You spawn in initially, naked, alone and with only a rock and torch. From here you must find your way, hitting trees for wood, breaking rocks for stone, sulfur and iron ore. Next comes your tools, your home and eventually server domination. 

You will need to work hard to be successful in Rust, by farming or hunting. However it is done, you have to do it. There are very few people you can trust, this is not a game to make friends on. This is kill or be killed, only the strong survive.

Build tools and weapons to help propel yourself to the top of the server. Raid people, loot monuments such as the dome, airfrield, military tunnels or rad towns. Whatever the means, you must do it to succeed and be strong.
